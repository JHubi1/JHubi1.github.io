# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Jakob and I make coding for fun!
I started early to get enthusiastic about programming. I love to think my way into (not too complex) problems and solve them.
Preferably, however, when everything works as it should.
On a side note, my favorite color is red!

## Programming Languages
I know the following languages:
+ HTML & JavaScript
+ Python
+ PHP
