# Hi, it's me! ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Jakob and I make coding for fun!
I started early to get enthusiastic about programming. I love to think my way into (not too complex) problems and solve them.
Preferably, however, when everything works as it should.
On a side note, my favorite color is red!

## Programming Languages
I know the following languages:
+ HTML & JavaScript
  + ```javascript
    document.write("Hello World!");
    ```
+ Python
  + ```python
    print("Hello World!")
    ```
+ PHP
  + ```php
    echo "Hello World!";
    ```

## Projects
Here you can find a list of the projects I am currently following. Some may not work anymore because they are outdated.
+ KeyConfig
  + This is a simple (and my first) Python module. It can be used to theoretically interpret any file as a configuration file.
+ IndexAPI (Old, but still functional)
  + A JavaScript script that brings all the important website functions.
+ (More coming soon!)
